# This project show how you can loadtest your minimal api application with locust.

Note:
The locust loadtests are hardcoded and some of them will fail because  the product doesn't exist when called

Usage:
```
docker compose up --build
```
 - Access localhost:8089 - to open the locust webpage
 - Start your loadtest
